## About

I built this template with all the tools I found useful to develop my own personal projects, so it can be a bit biased. If you find something that you think is not relevant or could be improved, please open an issue or a pull request to fix it.

## Features

**React.js with TypeScript**

- Because I love strongly typed languages

**Lint & format**

- ESLint
- Prettier
- Pre-commit hook included to lint your staged files.

**Testing Setup**

- Jest
- React Testing Library to make tests that mimic real user interactions

**UI**

- TailwindCSS 2
- CSS modules are also supported by default by next.js

**APIs**

- The demo project does not use it, but with next.js you can have your APIs in a dedicated folder in the same repo and deploy them in no time with Vercel.

**SEO**

- Populate each page header metadata with name, description, image, etc.

**Deployment**

- CI with GitHub Actions
- Ready to deploy on Vercel using git integration or the command line (see 'deployment' section below)

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jsulpis/nextjs-template.git && cd nextjs-template && yarn install
```

## Usage

### Development

Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000.

```
yarn dev
```

### Build

Build for production: next.js automatically renders static HTML pages when possible. Then if you deploy on Vercel you can have both statically rendered pages and server-side rendered pages (as lambdas functions).

```
yarn build
```

Launch a server for server-side rendering (after building the application):

```
yarn start
```

Generate a fully static project with pre-rendered pages to put directly on a server or any static website hosting platform. Note that you lose the possibility to have server-side rendered pages. With Vercel you should not have to run this command.

```
yarn export
```

## Deployment

This template is ready to be deployed on Vercel:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=https://github.com/jsulpis/nextjs-template)

You can integrate Vercel with your GitHub account, which allows it to deploy each branch and pull request to their own environment, and the main branch in production.

## Configuration

See the [documentation page](https://nextjs-template.juliensulpis.vercel.app/docs)
